# Tunedrop

Find out what music others are listening to and post tunes as well.

[Tunedrop](https://songdrop.herokuapp.com/tunes) runs on [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/), the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) framework, and is hosted for free on [Heroku](https://songdrop.herokuapp.com/tunes).

I built Tunedrop for two reasons:

1. To learn Phoenix and Elixir
2. To bring the joy of the music I grew up with to my daughters

Anyone can eavesdrop on the music, but to post what you are listening to, you have to register.

After you register you can use your API token to post what's playing in iTunes using [this script](https://github.com/cblackburn/tunedrop/blob/master/now_playing.sh), if you are running on a Mac. I'm working on a launch daemon to have it post automatically, but until that is released you have to run the script manually.

Feel free to [send me feedback](mailto:e7d2582b@opayq.com)
